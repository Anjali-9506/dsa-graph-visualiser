## üöÄ About The Project

The DSA Graph Visualizer is a passion project born from a love for data structures and a desire to make complex algorithms more accessible and understandable. This tool allows users to build graphs from scratch, import data, and watch algorithms like Dijkstra's, Bellman-Ford, and Topological Sort execute step-by-step in real-time.

Whether you're a student learning these concepts for the first time or a developer looking for a quick way to visualize a graph problem, this tool is designed for you.

## üöÄ Live Demo

*   **Live Application (Render):** **[DSA Graph Visualizer](https://dsa-graph-visualiser.onrender.com)**

### ‚ú® Features

- **Interactive Canvas:** Drag-and-drop nodes, create edges with a `Shift+Click` gesture, and resize the workspace.
- **Rich Algorithm Suite:** Visualize 8 fundamental graph algorithms with detailed, step-by-step animations.
- **Dual Graph Types:** Seamlessly switch between **Directed** and **Undirected** graphs.
- **Multiple Input Methods:**
  - Add nodes and edges one by one.
  - Use the **interactive Adjacency Matrix Constructor** to build graphs from data.
- **Live Data Views:** See the **Adjacency List** and **Adjacency Matrix** update in real-time as you modify the graph.
- **On-Hover Insights:** Instantly view a node's **Degree** (or In/Out-Degree) just by hovering.
- **Professional UI/UX:** Light & Dark themes, a helpful tutorial, saved graph states, and a fully responsive layout.
